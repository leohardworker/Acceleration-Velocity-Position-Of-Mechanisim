This code is used to model the motion of a mechanism subjected to a specific force over time and visualize how this motion changes. The program takes user inputs for the initial velocity, initial position, applied force, and mass of the mechanism. Then, it calculates the acceleration of the mechanism using Newton's second law of motion (F = m * a, where F is force, m is mass, and a is acceleration).

This acceleration is used to update the velocity and position of the mechanism within a specific time interval (time_interval), and these updated values are plotted over time.

Here's what each part of the code does:

Mechanism Class:

__init__: Initializes the mechanism, setting the initial velocity, initial position, acceleration (initialized to 0), time (initialized to 0), and empty lists to store accelerations, velocities, and positions.
calculate_acceleration: Computes acceleration using Newton's second law of motion.
update: Computes acceleration within a given time interval, updates the velocity and position of the mechanism, and appends these values to lists for time, acceleration, velocity, and position.
User Input:

Takes user inputs for initial velocity, initial position, time interval (time_interval), total time, applied force, and mass of the mechanism.
Updating the Mechanism:

Inside a while loop, the code calls the update method to model how the mechanism moves over time. This method calculates acceleration within a specific time interval, updates the velocity and position of the mechanism.
Creating Graphs:

Utilizes the matplotlib library to create three separate graphs showing how velocity, acceleration, and position change over time. These graphs have time on the x-axis and velocity, acceleration, and position on the y-axis.
In summary, this code provides a visual representation of how a mechanism moves in response to a given force. It calculates and displays the mechanism's velocity, acceleration, and position over time, allowing users to understand the behavior of the system in a graphical manner.
