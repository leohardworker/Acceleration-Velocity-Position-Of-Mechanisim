# Acceleration-Velocity-Position-Of-Mechanisim
This program creates a Mechanism class and retrieves from the user the initial velocity, initial position, time, applied force, and mass of the mechanism. Then, using Newton's laws of motion, it updates the acceleration, velocity, and position, printing the results to the screen.
