# Constants
g = 9.81  # Acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2)

# User input
initial_velocity = float(input("Enter initial velocity (m/s): "))
initial_position = float(input("Enter initial position (m): "))
time = float(input("Enter time (s): "))

# Calculating acceleration (1st equation of motion: F = m * a -> a = F / m)
acceleration = g

# Calculating velocity (2nd equation of motion: v = u + at -> v: final velocity, u: initial velocity, a: acceleration, t: time)
velocity = initial_velocity + acceleration * time

# Calculating position (3rd equation of motion: s = ut + (1/2)at^2 -> s: position, u: initial velocity, a: acceleration, t: time)
position = initial_position + initial_velocity * time + 0.5 * acceleration * time**2

# Printing the results
print("Final velocity: {:.2f} m/s".format(velocity))
print("Final position: {:.2f} m".format(position))
